### Blog improvements

This meta post lists the most recent changes which have been made to the
structure of the site. Specifically, the blog has gone over a series of changes:

- **Projects page:** Added a [projects](/projects) page, which lists some of my
  non-work related projects, that I have done over the years.
- **Improved post structure:** Posts are now grouped by their category on the
  front page, and likewise the categories have been divided into four major
  themes:
  - *functional programming*,
  - *mathematics*,
  - *meta*, and
  - *tools and techniques*.

The new *tools and techniques* category will feature posts on topics such as:
  - *apps and command line tools for improving your productivity*,
  - *micro improvements to your git work flow*, and
  - *using Emacs for non-programming tasks*.
