### Blog improvements

This meta post simply lists the recent changes which have been made to the
general look and feel of the blog. Specifically, the blog has gone over a series
of changes:

- **A new color scheme:** The general color scheme of the blog has been migrated
  from the standard [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) colors to the
  [Solarized theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized), created by Ethan
  Schoonover, which reduces brightness contrast while still retaining high
  readability.
- **No more gists:** The [Github
  Gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/) are gone in favour of
  Jekyll's own highlight tag, as this significantly reduces the recompilation
  time when editing a blog post. Furthermore, this also aligns neatly with the
  new Solarized color theme.
- **More space:** The space between lines has also been increased to further
  improve legibility.
