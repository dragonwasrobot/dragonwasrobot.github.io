#### Description

The [formal-moessner](https://github.com/dragonwasrobot/formal-moessner) project
was the culmination of my Master's thesis in Computer Science, **A Formal Study
of Moessner's Sieve**, completed at Aarhus University in 2014 under the
supervision of Olivier Danvy. The thesis presents a new characterization of a
mathematical procedure known as Moessner's Process, or Moessner's Sieve, for
generating a stream of successive powers from the stream of natural numbers. As
a result of the new characteristic, the thesis also introduced a range of new
mathematical results surrounding the properties of Moessner's Process.

The thesis was part of the four nominations for **Best Master's Thesis in
Computer Science 2014** in Denmark, and it was later published as an eBook by
Aarhus University Library.

Below is a series of blog posts that condenses the thesis into the 10 major
ideas and insights of the thesis while stripping away the proof-heavy parts of
the thesis, making it approachable from a recreational math perspective.
