# The Who
I am a newly graduated computer scientist with a soft spot for:

- Programming languages,
- software architecture,
- distributed systems, and
- mobile/web development.

Currently, I am working at [Silverbullet](http://www.silverbullet.dk/) as a
professional bit shifter where my main focus is on developing the
[OpenTele](http://opentele.silverbullet.dk/) telemedicine system.

My interests include but are not limited to:

- Watching a lot of old movies,
- attending concerts and discovering new music,
- grinding my own coffee beans, and
- general geekery like learning Haskell, chess or writing an emulator.

# The What
The completely novel idea of a programming blog to share the cool stuff I
stumble upon and once in a while might even code.

# The Why
Just because.
