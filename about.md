### The What

A blog mostly about functional programming, some mathematics, and their
intersection.

### The Who

Computer scientist with a soft spot for:

- Programming language theory,
- software architecture, and
- distributed systems.

I am currently working at [OpenTeleHealth](http://www.opentelehealth.com/) as a
professional bit shifter, where I am part of the core team developing the
OpenTele telemedicine platform for remote patient monitoring.

### The Why

As a tool for reflection and sharing.

### The Name

The name of the blog, *dragonwasrobot*, is from the ending credit of a poorly
translated version of
[Wonderboy in Monsterland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_in_Monster_Land)
which I used to play on my old Amiga 500 as a kid.
