# The Who

Computer scientist with a soft spot for:

- Programming languages,
- software architecture,
- distributed systems, and
- mobile/web development.

I am currently working at [OpenTeleHealth](http://www.opentelehealth.com/) as a
professional bit shifter where I help develop the OpenTele telemedicine system.

My interests include but are not limited to:

- Watching a lot of old movies,
- attending concerts and discovering new music,
- grinding my own coffee beans, and
- general geekery like learning Haskell, chess or writing an emulator.

Oh, and the name of the blog, *dragonwasrobot*, is from the ending credit of a
poorly translated version of
[Wonderboy in Monsterland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_in_Monster_Land)
which I used to play on my old Amiga 500 as a kid.

# The What

A blog about programming, math and their intersection.

# The Why

As a tool for reflection and sharing.
