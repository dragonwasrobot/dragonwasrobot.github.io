### The What

A blog mostly about functional programming, some mathematics, and their
intersection.

### The Who

Computer scientist with a soft spot for:

- Programming language theory,
- software architecture, and
- distributed systems.

I am currently working at [Doccla](https://www.doccla.com/) as a Staff Software
Engineer working within the Engineering Excellence team focusing on improving
the foundation of its Remote Patient Monitoring platform.

### The Why

As a tool for reflection and sharing.

### The Name
  
The name of the blog, *dragonwasrobot*, is from the ending credit of a poorly
translated version of [Wonderboy in
Monsterland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_in_Monster_Land) which I
used to play on my old Amiga 500 as a kid.
